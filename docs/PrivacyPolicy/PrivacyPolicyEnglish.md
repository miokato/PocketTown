Last updated: 28 June 2025

## 1. Introduction  
The individual developer (“we”, “our”) respects your privacy. This policy explains how **MyTown Pocket** (“the app”) collects and uses personal data.

---

## 2. Data We Collect  

| Category | Items | How | Purpose |
|----------|-------|-----|---------|
| Location | Latitude & longitude | iOS location API | Display 1-km map and fetch weather |
| Pin data | Pin coordinates, title, note | User input | Bookmark and share favorite spots |
| Logs | Crash reports | Automatically via Apple | Quality improvement |

> **We do not collect name, email, Ad ID, or analytics data.  
> No third-party ad/analytics SDKs are integrated.**

---

## 3. Use & Sharing  

- Location stays **on device** and is never sent to external servers.  
- When you set a pin to **Public**, the pin is stored in **iCloud (CloudKit Public DB)** and becomes visible to other users within the same 1-km radius.  
- We never share data with third parties except as required by law.

---

## 4. Retention & Deletion  

- Location is processed only in real time and not stored.  
- Public pins are removed from CloudKit immediately when you set them to Private or delete them.  
- Deleting your Apple ID also deletes related CloudKit data per Apple policy.

---

## 5. Your Choices  

- You may deny or revoke location permission at any time in iOS Settings.  
- Use in-app controls or email us (see Section 9) to delete public pins.

---

## 6. Security  

All network traffic is encrypted (TLS) and local data is protected by iOS sandboxing.

---


## 7. Changes to This Policy  

Updates will be posted in-app or on this page.
